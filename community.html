    <p>There are approximately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers">
      260 million speakers</a> of Russian worldwide. It is the 8th most spoken language
      in the world and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language#Geographic_distribution">
      one of the six official languages</a> of the United Nations. Although most speakers live within Russia
      and Eastern Europe, there are Russian-language communities in The United Kingdom, Germany,
      France, and other countries in Western Europe. Russian is an international language spoken across
      the world, with language communities in most major American cities. Since 2013, Russian has been
      the <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language/all">second most used
      language on the internet</a> after English.</p>
